okay i think thats it he rises and walks to the door	mr hardy
somebody emptied a full clip into him	stop
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar	how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten

epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer	my heart weeps
is it the truth	theres that word again as i told you i wasnt in the room when everyone started shooting
i believe your next line is what are you trying to hide	well
something funny levi	i was just thinking of whats going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
jail if hes lucky the gas chamber if hes not	i didnt do anything
why	because of what i saw who really killed west
how do you know	because i was standing next to him
or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him	i didnt
i didnt	but you cant prove it you cant prove anything until we find the bodies

we have a man down	coop where are you
coop where are you	the containment second containment
the containment second containment	hold on coop
but justin	ill get him
captain miller were ready to repressurize the clark	on my way
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before	you prep the gravity couches im going to manually arm those explosives
you prep the gravity couches im going to manually arm those explosives	will it work
will it work	it worked for weir prep the tanks
what	you heard me this ship its crazy trying to go fastern light thats like the tower of babel
you heard me this ship its crazy trying to go fastern light thats like the tower of babel	shit smith youre going biblical on me
shit smith youre going biblical on me	you know what happened to the tower of babel dont you it fell down
you know what happened to the tower of babel dont you it fell down	youre sucking too much nitrogen in your mix
well have to reroute through the port conduit to the apu	what about the accumulator
its holding shes holding	were still venting trace gasses gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole
smith clear that airlock man im coming in	roger that
damn dr weir dont scare us like that coffee	what
what	coffee
coffee	no thank you
it was like nothing was there and then justin appeared and the core became metal	no he didnt
no he didnt	you werent there i saw it
you werent there i saw it	saw what mr cooper what did you really see because what youre describing is not physically possible
i dont know what happened to justin	im telling you i saw it
im telling you i saw it	what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion	i know what i saw and it wasnt a fucking optical effect
is that an offer	it is not
whats happening	i dont know the screens are dead
let me breathe let me breathe	youre okay now its over
how the bridge is gone	there must be a way what about engineering
there must be a way what about engineering	can you shut it down
can you shut it down	i dont know the process dr weir was the expert
i dont know the process dr weir was the expert	i dont want to go where the last crew went id rather be dead
im gonna activate the emergency beacon	hurry
what	run
hes a rescue technician peters medical technician dj	trauma
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement	goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity anyone who can should get some sleep	i dont need sleep dj i need answers
hell live if we ever make it back	well make it
what is it	ive been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
ive been listening to the transmission and i think houston made a mistake in the translation	go on
they thought it said liberatis me save me but its not me its tutemet save yourself	its not a distress call its a warning
its not a distress call its a warning	it gets worse
do you hear it right there	hear what
hear what	it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi hell	save yourself from hell what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
dj the clarks gone smith and cooper are dead	what happened
what happened	weir he used one of the explosives from the corridor
please	oh god dj what do i how do i
oh god dj what do i how do i	please kill
please kill	oh god
whats wrong	nothing its nothing
whats happening	a power drain
whats wrong	you didnt hear it you must have heard it
ive got a pulse hes alive	pressure
pressure	90 over 50 and falling
90 over 50 and falling	hes crashing
intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood	his peritoneum has ruptured
his peritoneum has ruptured	one thing at a time lets keep him breathing start the drip 15ccs fibrinogen christ hes bleeding out
you wanted to see me admiral	i apologize for the short notice bill but weve had something come up that requires your immediate attention lyle
incredible these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened this isnt some kind of hoax	i wouldnt bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and id codes
i wouldnt bring you here on a hoax houston confirms the telemetry and id codes	its the event horizon shes come back
thank you	dont thank me bill im not doing you any favors
its not that simple lyle play the recording for dr weir	navigation control tried to hail the vessel this was the only response
does he know that	whats on your mind
its been two years since she died hes over it	some things you dont get over
i want our best people on this wheres miller	the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt shes docked in bay four
what justin what shows you	it wont stop it goes on and on and on
it wont stop it goes on and on and on	what does
what does	the dark inside me
its inside and it eats and eats until theres nothing left	the dark inside i dont understand
the dark inside i dont understand	from the other place
oh my god oh my god	starck
how do you know all this	i built it
youve reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side	we still have pressure the radiation counts steady at 7 millirads an hour
we still have pressure the radiation counts steady at 7 millirads an hour	background radiation perfectly safe
ive reached another containment door this things huge	thats the second containment seal beyond that engineering
thats the second containment seal beyond that engineering	im going in
everything green on my boards skipper	start the countdown
justin finish your sweep	almost done i just gotta check one thing
justin	skipper you gotta help me
but i cant i gotta get out of here skipper please	justin i wont let you die
this is weir	dr weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
since the initial transmission theres been no further contact just the beacon every two minutes	the crew could they still be alive
the crew could they still be alive	the ship had life support systems for eighteen months theyre been gone seven years
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months theyre been gone seven years	someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship
whats the hold up	just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months	i put in for a replacement for you but no one
weve got pressure	clear and open on my mark three two one mark
jesus its huge	ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze
that means they didnt abandon ship	so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan
peters is right no ones here	i dont know this place is really dark i cant see a thing
i can see the hatch	starck you still showing those readings
the blood came from somewhere peters	theres no one here skipper
okay im on the bridge	what you got peters
everythings been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull its intact	the science workstation has power ill see if i can find the crew from here
i found one	alive
alive	frozen
hows the client	crystallized
can anybody hear me	skipper
skipper	peters
you okay	yeah im im okay
peters i want you to go through the ships log see if we cant find some answers	i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin	fine starck i want you to repeat the bioscan
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up	do it
thats a negative starck	justin
peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us	ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there
ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there	thanks
ive been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space	until then do what youre told and stay out of my way
where has it been for the last seven years	thats what were here to find out
what does it say	nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
thats the engineering containment and theres the main airlock we can dock there	smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster	be careful its not a load bearing structure
dr weir i need you on the bridge	captain i didnt come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
captain i didnt come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship	once the ship is secured well bring you on board
once the ship is secured well bring you on board	that is not acceptable
youre in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering	peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hotdogging not on this one alright
easy peters were okay were okay lets finish the sweep	captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
any survivors	negative
no one	theyre empty dr weir moving forward
it beats dying mister smith	dr weirs right get on board the event horizon ill meet you at the airlock
yes	one of my men is down i want to know what happened to him
what could cause them whats in the core	its complicated
its complicated	how much time do you need we have seventeen hours and fortytwo minutes now what is in the core
if it worked	if it worked yes
i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits	theres no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields its under control
you have something dr weir	the date
the date	what about it
what about it	the event horizons computer thinks its 2034
the event horizons computer thinks its 2034	its 2041
its 2041	exactly the ships internal clock is off by seven years
what the hell is that dr weir	i dont know
we dont get the power back our airs gonna go bad	check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain	do it
is that your expert opinion the only answer weve had out of you is i dont know	justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations	thats bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all ive heard from you is bullshit
thats bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all ive heard from you is bullshit	what do you want me to say
what do you want me to say	you said this ship creates a gateway
you said this ship creates a gateway	yes
yes	to what where did this ship go where did you send it
to what where did this ship go where did you send it	i dont know
i dont know	where has it been for the past seven years
where has it been for the past seven years	i dont know
i dont know	the other place what is that
were leaving	you cant your orders are specific

your eyes	i dont need them anymore where were going we wont need eyes to see
i dont need them anymore where were going we wont need eyes to see	what are you talking about
if you miss me youll blow out the hull youll die too	what makes you think ill miss
weir is dead	then who the fuck are you
then who the fuck are you	your fear do you remember the goliath miller
what are you	you know
you know	you want me to believe youre the devil well i dont thats bullshit

then what what are you tell me	better if i just show you
there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing	youre lying
you cant have them go to hell	nooo
jesus	what is that
heading threethreefour	make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees	onefour degrees
what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings	something like that yeah
i guess were about to find out keep us slow and steady	yes sir
yes sir	dr weir
weve got some weather	i noticed starck anybody home
1500 meters were getting too close	where is it
proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 were right on top of it were gonna hit	starck
put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby	love to
it is now were locked in	starck give me a read
captain miller	smith where the hell have you been
smith where the hell have you been	we have a situation here
do we have enough time for a weld	we dont have time to fart
no ones dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks	theyre gone
but	you heard me smith peters are you with me
captain miller you copy	im here smith hows the clark
we dont have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air	understood
sir	get outside go back to work ill join you shortly
thank you	captain we got a problem
captain we got a problem	now what
now what	she was right behind me i turn around shes gone she could be anywhere
she was right behind me i turn around shes gone she could be anywhere	alright prep the clark for launch ill find her
skipper	what is it smith
what is it smith	i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark
smith get out of there	come again skipper
come again skipper	one of the explosives is missing from the corridor i think weir may have put it on the clark
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock	no no we just got her back together
no no we just got her back together	get out of there now
where is it where is it	smith smith fuck
were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready	justin
ion drive will engage in tminus ten minutes	lets go
starck why arent you on the bridge	i just finished drying
i just finished drying	then what are you doing here come on people lets go and cooper put some pants on
crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees	come around to threethreefour
somethings wrong with the bioscan	radiation interference
thats an affirmative	keep your eyes open
everybody okay	were all here
were all here	okay lets find out how much time we just bought
it tastes bad	but you can breathe it
how much ohtwo do we have	oxygen is not the problem
oxygen is not the problem	carbon dioxide
carbon dioxide	its building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot
its building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot	we can take the filters from the clark
whats causing the readings	i dont know but whatever it is its not the crew
i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins	do it dr weir
maybe one of the original crew	no it was someone else
no it was someone else	who
who	dr weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
miller	what is it starck
what is it starck	i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin
i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin	bioreadings of indeterminate origin dont you have anything useful to tell me
bioreadings of indeterminate origin dont you have anything useful to tell me	ive got a theory
youve got to listen	to what what are you saying this ship is alive
its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports	starck do you know how crazy that sounds its impossible
starck do you know how crazy that sounds its impossible	i know that
if you knew it was impossible then whyd you waste my time	i thought you wanted an answer and thats the only one i have
what i want is to survive the next ten hours	nine hours and twentytwo minutes
miller come in	whats going on in there starck
whats going on in there starck	justins in the airlock
what	hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit
hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit	stay here dont stop working
im on my way starck	you better hurry hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door
tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can	five seconds
weir cant be alive	whatever was on that bridge wasnt weir
weir activated the drive hes sending us to the other place	weve got to shut it down weve got to
blow the fucker up	blow it up
ill do it	no ill be right back
repeat were armed	miller hes back he was in the tank
weir	hes dead
first time in a grav couch	yes
hes been past mars	he served on the goliath
he served on the goliath	wasnt that ship destroyed
claire	dj its okay youre okay just breathe
heres another one theyre all over the place	theyre explosive charges
dr weir whats this the door to	youre at the bridge ms peters you still havent seen any crew
yes we can see some kind of mist what is that	blood looks like arterial spray
blood looks like arterial spray	can you see a body
can you see a body	theres no one here
no i saw nothing	i did
isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge	ive seen bodies before this is different
theres no one in the corridor but us	not according to the computer
hes engaged the override	can you shut it down
yes yes justin we heard it	keep him talking
keep him talking	do you know what it was
almost got it	come on babybear open this door
we have to do something oh god	skipper justin just activated the door its on a thirty second delay
you got any coffee	its cold
its cold	i dont care
where is she	dead ahead 5000 meters
jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker	shes not ugly
what the hell is that	thats the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship
the safety circuits failed	were losing atmosphere
what	it still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
i didnt see anything and i dont have to see anything this ship is fucked	thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith	hey you dont need to be a scientist figure it out
30 hours to neptune orbit	all boards are green everythings five by five
you cant do that	the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel
if they are theyre screening their calls	range 3000 meters and closing
the scope is lit its right in front of us	1000 meters
range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off	picking up magnetic interference
what happened to his eyes	explosive decompression
explosive decompression	decompression wouldnt do that
miller do you read me peters	get them back
get them back	im trying goddammit
what if the air has gone bad we cant wear these suits forever	i dont think this is a good idea we dont even know what happened on that ship
a straight line	wrong the shortest distance between two points
the reactors still hot weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious	do they have pressure
what is it	ships log
what is it	i dont know the life readings just went off the scale
claire is your wife	yes
yes	it must be hard being so far away from her
it must be hard being so far away from her	yes i miss her she died two years now
yes i miss her she died two years now	im sorry
what are you doing	it wants me i have to go
in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset	im alright please
what is it	the forward airlock
the forward airlock	miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock
justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean	it means nothing
i dont think shes real big on hate	you wouldnt say that if you could see me
such a sad face you know sometimes being different isnt a bad thing	trust me this aint one of those times
howd you know it was me	im blind not deaf wanna come in
im not really dressed for a party	relax its casual
relax its casual	no i mean im a little dusty
those yours too	my stepdads im strictly into stone i was wondering when youd walk by
were going to have to work on your touch	i like the sound of that
you know you coulda run an ad in the personals	sensual blind chick seeks three ton rockhard heman for deep spiritual relationship

my apologies miss as you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted	captain barbossa i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal
i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request means no	very well
ill drop it	my holds are bursting with swag that bit of shine matters to me why
you have a name missy	elizabeth turner im a maid in the governors household
youve got sand for a maid	thank you sir
thank you sir	and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that a family heirloom perhaps
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that a family heirloom perhaps	of course i didnt steal it if thats what you mean
maid or not it fits you	dare i ask the fate of it previous owner
dare i ask the fate of it previous owner	now none of that please dig in
oh there would be no sense in killing you miss turner	then why arent you eating
then why arent you eating	would that i could
do you not know what this is then	its a pirate medallion
its a pirate medallion	its a piece of the treasure of isla de muerta
agreed you have my word as a gentleman of fortune	will you cant trust him
man overboard	boy overboard
boy overboard	fetch a hook haul him out of there
did he speak	his name is will turner thats all i found out
his name is will turner thats all i found out	very good
i cant breathe	im a bit nervous myself
commodore i must protest pirate or not this man saved my life	one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness
on his heels gillette bring a squad down from the fort elizabeth are you	yes im all right im fine go capture him
elizabeth im relieved youre safe clap him in irons and behind his back this time	commodore you cant do that
commodore you cant do that	youre speaking up for him again
youre speaking up for him again	he can locate isla de muerta but i doubt hell be willing to help us from the brig
commodore i beg you please do this for me as a wedding gift	i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr turner
i am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition i rescue mr turner	not as a condition a request
elizabeth i hereby withdraw my proposal	what
what	i know where your heart truly lies
you may seclude yourself in my cabin im afraid we do not have any ladies clothing aboard	then i can wear mens clothing
then i can wear mens clothing	that would hardly be proper
elizabeth is everything all right are you decent	yes yes
its beautiful may i inquire as to the occasion	is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts
although i did think you could wear it to the ceremony today	ceremony
ceremony	captain norringtons promotion ceremony
i knew it	or rather commodore norrington a fine gentleman dont you think he fancies you you know
difficult to say	im told that dress is the very latest fashion in london
im told that dress is the very latest fashion in london	women in london must have learned to not breathe
elizabeth this is hardly appropriate	about the day we met do you remember
i know the code	if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete
if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete	it would appear so do you
youll be dining with the captain and he requests you wear this	tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request
i could never forget it miss swann	will how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth
will how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth	at least once more miss swann as always
im glad we got here in time	truthfully you were a bit late
why would my father send this to me	to keep it away from them no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock
to keep it away from them no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock	if i had known
if i had known	then we never would have met
i cant believe he would make such a sacrifice for us	i guess you can never truly know someone elses heart
there and dont you dare tell me that wasnt a proper kiss	elizabeth i think it doesnt matter that we are of a different class
elizabeth i think it doesnt matter that we are of a different class	it doesnt
it doesnt	but that was not a proper kiss
miss swann	miss swann if youll be so kind
you are despicable	i saved your life now youve saved mine were square
you	me
me	youre in league with barbossa
youre in league with barbossa	no im rescuing you
come on	no this wont work ill stay behind and fight them you go on
has it changed since the last time you were here	the trees are taller
captain sparrow we have to get off this island immediately	dont be thinking im not already working on it
what whats wrong how will this help us get off the island	it wont it wont and so we wont

drink up me hearties yo ho	what what was that something funny miss swann share please
what what was that something funny miss swann share please	nothing its nothing just im reminded of a song i learned as a child a song about pirates
nothing its nothing just im reminded of a song i learned as a child a song about pirates	i know a lot of songs about pirates but none id teach a child lets hear it
that was before i met one of course	now i must hear this song an authentic pirate song have at it
now i must hear this song an authentic pirate song have at it	well perhaps with a bit more to drink i might
well perhaps with a bit more to drink i might	more to drink
jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again	ah well the company is better than last time and the scenery has definitely improved
ah well the company is better than last time and the scenery has definitely improved	mr sparrow im not sure ive had enough rum to allow that kind of talk
mr sparrow im not sure ive had enough rum to allow that kind of talk	weve got a few bottles left and weve yet to tap the kegs
to freedom	to the black pearl
what are you doing youve burned our food the shade the rum	yes the rum is gone
why	one because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels two
you you burned up the island for a onetime chance at being spotted	exactly
you didnt tell commodore norrington everything	nor did you i noticed
nor did you i noticed	he might delay the rescue and that would be too late
he might delay the rescue and that would be too late	exactly
exactly	these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed
these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed	i have a plan if it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief and onesided
i have a plan if it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief and onesided	whats your plan
make it last then now whats the nature of this venture of yours	first have you found me a crew
say again	im going after the black pearl i know where its going to be and im going to take it
im going after the black pearl i know where its going to be and im going to take it	jack its a fools errand youve heard the tales they tell about the pearl
a fools errand	not if the fool has something barbossa wants something he needs
not if the fool has something barbossa wants something he needs	and youve got that have you
kids a bit of a stick isnt he	that he is
wed best drop canvas sir	she can hold a bit longer
whats in your head to put you in such a fine mood	were catching up
how did you get off the island	ah thats a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold
blast it im already awake	i know that was for the smell
its a signal if we resist it wont just be death therell be torture as well	were not going to just surrender
were not going to just surrender	that we are
we can at least fight we might be able to kill a few	will itll go worse for us for elizabeth especially if we fight
raise the sails	the wind is quarter from astern by the time were underway well never catch them
the wind is quarter from astern by the time were underway well never catch them	we need only to come about to put them in range of the long nines
hands come about jackets off the cannons we are to fire on our own ship	better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate
all the men in place sir ready to fire	wait for my order what the blazes is that
sir shall i break out the cannons	i dont think that will be necessary
dead serious	you understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men youll never make it out of the bay
you understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men youll never make it out of the bay	well see about that
agreed you have the momentary advantage sir but i will see you smile from the yard arm sir	as likely as not will short up the anchor weve got ourselves a ship
this dock is offlimits to civilians	sorry i didnt know
some sort of todo up at the fort eh you two werent invited	no somone has to make sure this dock stays offlimits to civilians
no somone has to make sure this dock stays offlimits to civilians	this must be some important boat
whats your name	smith
well well jack sparrow isnt it	captain jack sparrow if you please
but it seems to be enough to condemn him	indeed
we had time to get to know each other	we are bound for port royal not isla de muerta
you would do that	they left me stranded twice what have you got to lose
they left me stranded twice what have you got to lose	nothing i wouldnt be please to be rid of
nothing i wouldnt be please to be rid of	i knew youd listen to reason
that chart i drew upll get you past the reefs if youre steersmans good enough that is	ill be at the wheel myself
you look familiar have i ever threatened you before	ive made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates
do you think this is wise boy crossing blades with a pirate	you threatened miss swann
you threatened miss swann	only a little
who makes all these	i do and i practice with them at least three hours a day
you cheated	pirate
move away	no
no	move
move	no i can not just step aside and let you escape
are you familiar with that ship the black pearl	somewhat
somewhat	where does it make berth
the ships real enough so its anchorage must be a real place where is it	why ask me
why ask me	because youre a pirate
because youre a pirate	and you want to turn pirate yourself
and you want to turn pirate yourself	never they took miss swann
i can get you out of here	how the keys run off
agreed	agreed
not without my effects	we need to go
id die for her	good
were going to steal a ship that ship	commandeer were going to commandeer a ship nautical term
commandeer were going to commandeer a ship nautical term	its still against the law
this is either crazy or brilliant	remarkable how often those two traits coincide
everybody stay calm were taking over the ship	aye avast
is that so	my father william turner
thats not true	i swear you look just like him
i swear you look just like him	its not true my father was a pirate
its not true my father was a pirate	figured you wouldnt want to hear it
figured you wouldnt want to hear it	he was a merchant marine he was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules
my father did not think of my mother his family as a burden	sure because he could always go pirating
sure because he could always go pirating	my father was not a pirate
put it away will its not worth getting beat again	you didnt beat me you ignored the rule of engagement in a fair fight id kill you
you didnt beat me you ignored the rule of engagement in a fair fight id kill you	then thats not much incentive for me to fight fair is it
tortuga	oh did i forget to mention that
just do it quickly	dont worry ive already got a quartermaster there
shut up before you lose them all	these are the only ones worth having and were going to need them
but i survived and i still have that single shot its meant for one man my mutinous first mate	barbossa
whats that	depends
depends	on what
miss swann were here to rescue you its going badly	this way
no	ill lead them away
go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship ill keep em busy	are you sure jack this is not something you have to do
do you have any idea where youre going	jack
jack	dont talk these caves magnify sound just follow me
are you certain this is the right way	its the right way
theres no real ship as can match the interceptor	the black pearl is a real ship
the black pearl is a real ship	no its not
no its not	yes it is ive seen it
yes it is ive seen it	youve seen it
youve seen it	yes
yes	youve seen the black pearl
youve seen the black pearl	yes
yes	you havent seen it
you havent seen it	yes i have
no	no
no	but ive seen a ship with black sails
no	like i said theres no real ship as can match hey
whats your business in port royal mr smith	and no lies
i think hes telling the truth	hes not telling the truth
hes not telling the truth	he may be
he may be	if he were telling truth he wouldnt have told us
that jack sparrow he talked about the black pearl	mentioned it is more what he did
mentioned it is more what he did	still
hes still breathing	where did he come from
what happened here	an explosion in the powder magazine merchant vessels run heavily armed
has my daughter given you an answer yet	no she hasnt
no she hasnt	well she had a very taxing day ghastly weather tonight
well she had a very taxing day ghastly weather tonight	bleak very bleak
commodore	a moment
a moment	but
but	please
please	dammit man it appears someone is stealing your ship
how long do you leave him in there	until hes done
look i dont mean to rain on everyones ascension here but we got a little problem	speak
speak	dr bright has escaped
wheelchair accessible	dr argon i demand an explanation
not anymore mr obrien the nanobot has changed that	if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself
if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself	you dont have to give it to us because dr nebbleman can just cut it out of him
mr sim i want you to return to dr brights i believe she is hiding something of ours there	no
you cant mean that	come with me susan i want to show you something
something to drink dr bright	no thank you
no thank you	youll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched poppy
we will always love most that which we create dont you agree susan	does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb
what are you going to do to him	do well i suppose that depends on you
what did you use	a light mixture of oxygen dioxide and sodium pentothal hell sleep thats all
poison im surprised at you you lack vision mr obrien	youre lacking a few things too ethics morals common decency and oh yeah deodorant
i should kill you right now for what you did to me	maybe you should but you cant
how apropos	aint it
i know what youre doing	you mean besides kicking your ass
you mean besides kicking your ass	you think you can use me to stop the meltdown
please obrien dont do this to me ill give you anything you want	yeah im going to finish what you started
you cant do this you owe me obrien i made you plastic i made you	thats right and making me was the biggest mistake you ever made
like rotting meat	youre not rotting meat
oh no smell this	icarus please if you want me to give you a bath just say so
icarus please if you want me to give you a bath just say so	no im getting used to it
shes working as fast as she can icarus it will be ready soon	its ready now i know it is
its ready now i know it is	she says its not
she says its not	shes lying she lost the first one on purpose
shes lying she lost the first one on purpose	she did not the mouse ran down the drain
she did not the mouse ran down the drain	she let it escape because she wants me to die
icky whats happening	who cares weve got to find him hurry
it works poppy it works it works	now icky i dont need you winding yourself up i need you focused and in control
now icky i dont need you winding yourself up i need you focused and in control	but poppy you dont know what this means
oh no no well get her assistant whatshisname nebbishman	nebbleman
a containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention	youre right place a call to our friends at the network and to mr joplin at the epa
gently ott gently	dr nebbleman i want to know the moment the nanobot arrives the instant understand
do you think she will give us the designs	eventually these things are always a matter of leverage
eventually these things are always a matter of leverage	and you think obrien is that leverage
and you think obrien is that leverage	that remains to be seen
and you still believe hes going to come here	based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable
based on what we know of him that would seem inevitable	do you think she loves him
do you think she loves him	she must feel something for him after all she and i did create him
poppy are you in one of your moods again	no icky this is real
why are there two ottomans	icarus please this is important
yes yes of course it is	then you still love me
then you still love me	poppy please just tell me what you want
icarus	i promise my dear i will give the matter some consideration
i promise my dear i will give the matter some consideration	consideration
consideration	if you honestly trust me then youll have to trust me
can you feel it poppy the presence of the moment can you feel the weight of its significance	oh yes icky i can feel it
oh yes icky i can feel it	this is what my entire life has been directed at this moment this threshold
this is what my entire life has been directed at this moment this threshold	okay arms up lean forward
it will be an ascension	im so excited icarus
i was wondering if youd finished considering	considering what
considering what	what i asked you earlier
poppy please	if you loved me like i loved you
if you loved me like i loved you	poppy this is not the time
did you feel that	did i ive been waiting for that for years
did i ive been waiting for that for years	not that
facts dr nebbleman facts youve been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment havent you	well yes the replicators are not as active at low temperatures
well yes the replicators are not as active at low temperatures	then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control
then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control	that might work
that might work	poppy order the trucks from the gary plant and were going to need a containment crew
she could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys	dr nebbleman take care of them
where did he go	the trunk
theyre here theyre here we have the nanobot	excellent how long until the assembler tank is complete
dr makeo is working on it now sir i estimate at least another six hours	in the meantime why dont you find something useful for dr bright to do
of course you understand dr argon that once the nanobot is inside of you there is no going back	shut up and do it
excellent work dr nebbleman you have outdone yourself	thank you sir
itll be better for us if he simply disappears the gardener will know what to do	wait wait can i at least have his body
wait wait can i at least have his body	donated to science perfect
hey	you dont want this
you dont want this	yeah i do
yeah i do	you have no idea what this is doing to your body
you have no idea what this is doing to your body	i like trix
here kid this is great stuff why dont you give it a try	i want trix mommy
yeah so what	so what so what for starters how about littering is a crime
so what so what for starters how about littering is a crime	hawhaw why dont you run off and find a cop and ill wait right here
what is it with you litterbugs is it a territorial thing marking your turf with your garbage	you better quit pushing me pal
what are you going to do make me throw it out	ill do whatever i have to do
what oh im sorry nigel i was just thinking	aaabout
aaabout	this morning i saw someone i havent seen in a long time
this morning i saw someone i havent seen in a long time	a man
a man	yeah i knew him when i was still in school
yeah i knew him when i was still in school	what did he want
do you remember about five years ago that uh incident at purnell labs	oh yeah they were working on molecular assemblers too werent they
oh yeah they were working on molecular assemblers too werent they	they also tried using viral rna as the bonding element
they also tried using viral rna as the bonding element	thats right cdc found out and closed them down
yeah but it wasnt a group it was one man	thats the guy
what did security say	theyll in validate the key probably nothing
theyll in validate the key probably nothing	well you got another problem
well you got another problem	the replicators
the replicators	worse mrs argon wants to talk to you shes waiting in the lab
worse mrs argon wants to talk to you shes waiting in the lab	this day just keeps going from bad to worse
i bet he hasnt read a single report weve written on the waste problem	i hope youre right id feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didnt care
i hope youre right id feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didnt care	what are you going to do
you were never invited to my house	youre looking for a urine sample
i dont believe this is happening	susan dr argon is giving you an opportunity here
susan dr argon is giving you an opportunity here	opportunity
theres a guard outside my door im a prisoner nigel do you understand that	dr argon would say we are all prisoners
is that what argon told you	no well not those exact words
no well not those exact words	nigel cant you see hes using you

youre afraid of him	who isnt
yes	its sim were almost there

whats it smell like	smell uh something like methylcyanoacrylate
smell uh something like methylcyanoacrylate	like crazy glue
like crazy glue	yes thats it hes got it oh god hes got it
sir please try to hold still	so i guess it worked
hes probably right sir the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight	and if we evacuate what do you want to do with obrien

youre insane	am i look right there thats exactly what i am talking about
daniel give him the trix	susan this is the future of america here
susie you gotta help me	daniel what are you doing here
daniel what are you doing here	please susan i need help something is wrong with me
please susan i need help something is wrong with me	sorry daniel im a physicist not a psychiatrist
sorry daniel im a physicist not a psychiatrist	no something is really wrong look
they did it to me	the nanobot
just like the mouse	mouse what mouse
mouse what mouse	my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse
my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse	what happened to it
what happened to it	i dont know
you dont know	it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment
it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment	but youve polymerized singlecelled bacteria and the fruit flies i know you have
but youve polymerized singlecelled bacteria and the fruit flies i know you have	yes
yes	then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure
oh god please this cant be happening i cant be plastic a plastic man	daniel
daniel	im a plastic man a plastic man
we dont have time for hysterics	we dont
what are these	mostly caffeine diuretics help you go to the bathroom
mostly caffeine diuretics help you go to the bathroom	why
pills you know how i feel about pills	if you dont want to do it this way i can remove it surgically
why do we need it	the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste
the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste	what waste
got it	the problem is the byproduct created by the process
the problem is the byproduct created by the process	the waste
the replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize	what happens
that was an egg	three days ago it was
three days ago it was	what do these replicators do to people
what do these replicators do to people	with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else
so right now theres little replicators spreading throughout argons lab	thats right
thats right	isnt it already too late then
i think while were waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you	youre the doctor
lungs sound fine you didnt have any preexisting physical conditions did you allergies infections	no why
is something wrong	no no i just feel wired
susan	what whats wrong
look at this	what about it
just look at it	the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl cyanoacrylate so whats wrong
whats that supposed to mean	just giving credit where credit is due
just giving credit where credit is due	you have no one to blame but yourself
you have no one to blame but yourself	blame the victim
this is what i deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists	youre not protecting the world youre obstructing progress
youre not protecting the world youre obstructing progress	i dont consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress
i dont consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress	and im sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world
and im sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world	but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate	come on i dont see you living in a cave
come on i dont see you living in a cave	and i dont see you sunbathing at chernobyl
just like old times	yeah old times

the nanobot its not here	its still inside me
how far can you stretch	i dont know
what did you want my hair for	something else i want to try
no cheese	i was hoping you were over that remember to keep drinking fluids
thats pretty good	getting used to it

did you go	on the counter
who is he	the head shrinker at the prison
i dont believe it youre here oh thank god	you didnt think i could just leave you
oh no argon we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot we have to get the nanobot	where is it
where is it	argons private lab
argons private lab	lets go
run daniel get out of here	im not leaving without you susan
you saved my life	did you think i could just leave you
what in the	oh shit the meltdown its spread to the tower
oh shit the meltdown its spread to the tower	weve got to get the nanobot
weve got to get the nanobot	its too late argon injected it
its too late argon injected it	you mean hes polymerized like me
that means the nanobot is still inside him	yes
yes	what would happen if i threw him into the core
what would happen if i threw him into the core	the same thing i suppose
daniel just forget argon lets get out of here well find another way to stop the waste	we dont have time to argue susan
youre not going after argon	i have to
i have to	do the words hero fantasies mean anything to you how about infantile dementia
i remember i was trying to help	god what a fight that was

vermin	can i help you mrs argon
i spoke to dr argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot	i am aware of dr argons frustrations
i am aware of dr argons frustrations	he believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now
is that a threat dr bright	look as i have said and will continue to say the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority
i could have you fired right now	you wont thats why youre whispering
icky	get him daniel knock his block off
okay barbie lets get this over with	dont worry four eyes
it might be paranoia but ive never lost my keycard before	paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured

actually i want to ask two favors of you one as a poet one as a detective	it sounds strange and im going to be very wary
and this poetry like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life	it goes beyond that it praises the goodness of god and the greatness of all his works
wait there is that other favor	id forgotten
id forgotten	tell me where jacqueline is weve got to find her
tell me where jacqueline is weve got to find her	you dont expect me to do that do you

perhaps	ill do all i can to help ill go to my publisher tomorrow
im afraid this is no time to play cyrano my friend what was in your mind	i wanted to get things clear for jacqueline let her know

dr judd	yes miss gibson ive come to take you to your sister

i was a great dancer	a strange collection youre like the false god you worship fallen angels all of you
it would be a charming experience she might only protest half as much	youre very flippant and perhaps wise but not wise enough to see the truth louis
is it about jacqueline	no shes no longer under my care
this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke	im very very serious
